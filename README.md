# Antarctic Lakes
Baseline dataset for sub-aerial Antarctic lake water chemistry and Python code

File "Antarctic baseline sub-aerial lake data.xlsx" contains a compilation of Antarctic sub-aerial permanently or seasonally ice-free lake and pond water data. Lakes are categorised as Saline or Freshwater ("Saline/freshwater" column) per publication "Temperature-driven changes in water chemistry of Antarctic ice-free subaerial lakes: Implications for hydrochemistry and nutrient cycling in a warming climate" by Liza K. McDonough, Krystyna M. Saunders, Jon Hawkings, John Gibson, Narelle Hegarty, William Berry Lyons and Karina T. Meredith.

File "Models.ipynb" contains the Python code used to generate figures 3, 4 and 5 in the above publication. The file "Antarctic baseline sub-aerial lake data.xlsx" is a data file. Sampling depth ("Depth") is presented in meters below surface. Conductivity is presented as ÂµS/cm. Na, K, Mg, Ca, Cl, Si, SO4, NO2, NO3, PO4 and DOC are presented as mg/L. Na:Cl, SO4:Cl, Mg:Cl, K:Cl and Ca:Cl represent ratios of the elements.
